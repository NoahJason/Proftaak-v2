This is an exam project.
This project has been made by 5 people.
It was a project we needed to make for school.

This project includes a custom made navbar, used with font-awesome and Javascript.
Also a slider made with Javascript.
Some lines of codes are off the net because we are still learning.

We have been busy with everything we always need, so the nav bar, and the footer, to created it and then include it in all the files.
For this was a little php needed.

Documentation is done by all members since this was mandatory.
